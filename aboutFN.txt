* About the ".fn" filename

Forword: The use of .fn files throughout this code is not a standard C practice
so I decided I would explain decision to use this.

Explaination: The .fn files hold an individual function with RobotC syntax
to allow for further seperation and organization of the code. The fn files are
brought together by a single "All.h" function in each subdirectory that
include all .fn files in that said directory to be used by the main program.
